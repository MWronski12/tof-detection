
Detection algorithm approaches:


DATA PIPELINE:


- Train test split data
- Evalauate


ALGORITHMIC EVALUATION
  
1) Simple

- Detect series of at least 3, non-zero, strictly monotonic measurements
- Calculate average velocity in each series
- Merge neighbouring series and average velocity estimation

2) Advanced

- Account for dropouts - try to fit fill the line with missing points
- Account for pedestrian and random movements - add logic to determine that motion is too slow, too long etc
- Account for multiple objects in the field of view - add more sophisticated logic to decide if neighbouring series should be merged
- Improve speed estimation - replace outlier measurements with samples fitting the line perfectly


MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES

1) Raw 1 second sliding window, starting at the first non-zero measurement
2) Extract features from a sliding window
